          <strong>Summary</strong> - Al'Khwarizmi was an Islamic mathematician
          who wrote on Hindu-Arabic numerals. The word algorithm derives from
          his name. His algebra treatise Hisab al-jabr w'al-muqabala gives us
          the word algebra and can be considered as the first book to be
          written on algebra. Thumbnail of Al-Khwarizmi View three larger

          Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi's life. One unfortunate effect of
          this lack of knowledge seems to be the temptation to make guesses
          based on very little evidence. In [1] Toomer suggests that the name
          al-Khwarizmi may indicate that he came from Khwarizm south of the
          Aral Sea in central Asia. He then writes:-."
